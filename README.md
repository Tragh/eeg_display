To get this working you'll need git, cargo and rust, then it's simply a case of


git clone https://github.com/Tragh/spectrum_analyser.git

cd spectrum_analyser

cargo run --release

This project uses PortAudio and will bind to whatever local version of PortAudio you have. You'll need to install PortAudio yourself before this project will build.
